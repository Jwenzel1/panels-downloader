# panels-downloader
This was just a fun pet project for when the Panels app accidentally leaked all of their wallpapers in a public bucket. They have fixed that issue, but this project can still work because of wiremock. This was mostly my attempt to learn about async rust programming. I learned about the tokio runtime and sending and recieving data through channels. If you want to run this yourself you just need open this in a devcontainer and open up two terminals. In the first terminal run `docker-compose up` and in the second terminal type `cargo run` and you should see a `wallpapers` directory get made and hundreds of the same image populate into it.
